# Soldier-Stars-Search-Problem

The soldier on the map shown below should collect the stars. The soldier can move in every of the 6 directions possible, but he should avoid the obstacles. A star is considered 'collected' when he steps over a field that contains a star. The script should display the actions taken to accomplish the goal.
